        <p>It’s especially recommended to take a look at websites by other people in your specific creative niche or industry. You can take notes or even make a mood board to accompany you throughout your creative process.How do you want visitors to move from one page to the next? By opening a menu or scrolling down for further information? Do you want your site to be a one-page website, or a gallery of fullscreen images that open up into individual pages? These are questions you’ll ask yourself at the next step, choosing your portfolio template. Your actual work is the core of your online portfolio, so make sure to showcase it in the best way possible. It should stand out and be easily reachable through the homepage and/or website menu. You can highlight this work by creating a dedicated “projects” page on your website.The photography portfolios require high quality images. To ensure that your work looks as impressive online as it does in real life, invest time and effort into photographing your work, your process and your products. In cases when a professional photoshoot is not feasible, work with mockups to bring your visuals to life. Once you have a good base from which you can set off and a collection of projects ready to display, it’s time to identify which additional content you want to include in your online portfolio, and how to present it strategically. This includes text, images and other media. </p>
